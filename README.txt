Membean autocomplete using autoclickers + google gemini API

based on 100% chrome gui scale and my screen resolution (2560 * 1600)
if you want to adapt to your computer you should multiple all screen coordinates by [your screen res X coordinate]/ 2560 , [your screen res Y coordinate] / 1600
program uses many python libraries that need installation via pip
- pip install pillow
- pip install time (also try pip install TIME-python)
- pip install pytesseract
- pip install pyautogui
- pip install pyperclip
- pip install google.generativeai
- pip install tkinter

obviously install python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

only important files are run.py and geminifunctions.py

if any blanchet person gets their hands on this, know that all of membean has been done by myself because i actually enjoy learning (plus you gotta be a little impressed, no?)

all code written by sachin miskelly (no vibe code)

email me for api key
